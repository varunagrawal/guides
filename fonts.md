# Fonts

This document provides an overview of how to use and install fonts to your system as well as recommends some nice fonts.

## Installing

- [nerd-fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) is a great one stop shop for various fonts. Just download and run `./install.sh`. The only con is that it is huge so it takes a while to run.
    You might want to consider installing specific fonts.

- You can also download individual fonts from places like [Google Fonts](fonts.google.com) and install them manually.

- ArchLinux may not recognize the fonts. In that case, you simply need to start the font manager and manually load the font file. You should then be able to use the font without issue.

## Recommendations

- Desktop UI:  Nunito (Same font that OSX uses).
- Web Browser: Lato (Makes your browser great to look at).
- Code Editors: Hack, FiraMono, Source Code Pro (In order of preference).
- Terminal: Mononoki (Really nice mono spaced font).
